   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>
    This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook some dried pasta in boiling salted water – we’re talking about quick and easy options here.
   </p>
   
   <h2>
    Ingredients
   </h2>
   
   <ul>
        <li>150 g dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
        <li>30 g Parmesan cheese , plus extra for grating</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.</li>
        <li>Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally, then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well.</li>
        <li>Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss with the bacon.</li>
        <li>Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan isn’t too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.</li>
        <li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
