        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl, season with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then beat well with a fork until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Place a small non-stick frying pan on a low heat to warm up.</li>
        <li>Grate the cheese onto a board and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add Â½ tablespoon of oil to the hot pan, then carefully pour in the eggs.</li>
        <li>Tilt the pan to spread them out evenly, using a fork to swirl the eggs around the pan a little.</li>
        <li>When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, ease around the edges of the omelette, then fold it over in half.</li>
        <li>When it starts to turn golden brown underneath, remove the pan from the heat and slide the omelette onto a plate. Delicious with a tomato salad and wholemeal bread.</li>
    </ol>
